----------------------------------------asgi.py----------------------------------------
The `asgi.py` file is the ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) configuration file for your Django project. ASGI is a specification between web servers and Python web frameworks/apps to communicate asynchronously, allowing for handling of long-lived connections and WebSockets.

Here's a breakdown of the content and purpose of each part of the `asgi.py` file:

1. **Comments**:
   - The initial comments provide a brief description of the ASGI configuration file and mention that it exposes the ASGI callable as a module-level variable named `application`.

2. **Imports**:
   - `os`: Standard Python library to interact with the operating system.
   - `get_asgi_application`: Function from `django.core.asgi` to get the ASGI application callable for Django.

3. **Environment Settings**:
   - `os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'lms.settings')`: Sets the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable to `'lms.settings'`. This tells Django which settings module to use. In this case, it's set to `lms.settings`, which is expected to be in the same directory as this `asgi.py` file.

4. **Application Variable**:
   - `application = get_asgi_application()`: Calls the `get_asgi_application` function to get the ASGI application instance for the Django project. This application instance is then assigned to the `application` variable, which is the ASGI callable that the web server will use to interact with the Django project.

In summary, `asgi.py` serves as the entry point for ASGI-compatible web servers to interact with your Django project. It sets up the necessary environment settings and provides the ASGI application callable, which handles incoming HTTP requests, WebSockets, and other asynchronous tasks for the Django project.
